    -   Lists separate audio-only tracks for individual download.
-   **Helpful Utilities**:

## üéÆ How to Use

The script works automatically.

2.  **Download a Video**:
    -   In the player controls at the top, click the **`‚¨á Download`** button.
    -   A dropdown menu will appear with several options:
        -   **`üé¨ Download Video (HLS)`**: This is the most powerful option. It opens a dialog where you can select from all available video and audio qualities.
        -   **`üìπ Direct MP4 Downloads`**: If available, this opens a simpler dialog to download a complete MP4 file directly.
        -   **`üìÑ Save HLS Stream`**: Saves a `.m3u8` file. Open this with a media player like VLC to stream the video directly.
        -   **`üìã Copy Stream URL`**: Copies the HLS stream URL to your clipboard.

3.  **Track Progress**: A notification will appear in the bottom-right corner, showing you the real-time download progress, speed, and final status.
